# volleyball-world-championship-height

Repository with the analysis of the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship players’ height distribution and its influence on the team’s performances.

Contains the Python code used for data scraping and a [jupyter notebook](volleyball-world-championship-data-analysis.ipynb) with the data treatment and graphs generation.

If you are using the Firefox browser the graphs on the notebook may not show, as [SVGs on GitHub may not render with Firefox](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files).

To install all the dependencies, you may use conda:

```
conda env create -f dependencies.yml
```
